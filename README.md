# degree_and_marksheet_creation_and_verification
To verify the authenticity of an academic degree, we propose a 
system which employs a digital signature scheme and timestamps 
using blockchain technology. As the number of universities and 
tertiary education students are increasing , the number of graduates 
is also constantly increasing. To manage and store the information 
of these students we propose a system with all the functionalities to 
do the above work properly. 

Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party 
validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. 
Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, 
transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom 
line â€” and means we need a better way. Enter blockchain. 

The aim for developing this project is to manage the records of students , generate 
marksheet and degree and verify marksheet and degree for its authenticity. We are 
using the ReactJS , ExpressJS framework, Blockchain technology. For the 
database, we used MySQL. Use of VScode IDE enables rapid development and helps 
in improving code quality. 

The website contains an admin panel, super admin panel and student panel. Super 
Admin can handle all the activities which include adding new universities, colleges 
and courses provided by them. Admin can add students, create marksheet and 
information about grading system. Student can view and download marksheet. 
The validator in our system is used for verification of the marksheets and degree 
provided to it by the user. 

The main purpose of this project is to build a system that can generate as well as 
validate degree and marksheet in a much better way than doing it manually and 
keeping the records physically. QR code based marksheets is a way to enhance and 
upgrade the current generated marksheets into more reliable as compared to before. 
The current old system has a lot of vulnerabilities that caused creation of fake degree.
