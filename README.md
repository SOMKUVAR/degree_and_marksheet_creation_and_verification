# degree_and_marksheet_creation_and_verification
To verify the authenticity of an academic degree, we propose a 
system which employs a digital signature scheme and timestamps 
using blockchain technology. As the number of universities and 
tertiary education students are increasing , the number of graduates 
is also constantly increasing. To manage and store the information 
of these students we propose a system with all the functionalities to 
do the above work properly.
